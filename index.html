                <h3>April Music Player in PyQt6</h3>
                <p>
                    Frustrated by the lack of interactive lyrics support in desktop music players, I created April Music Player to bridge the gap between music enjoyment and language learning. While preparing for the EPS exam and learning Korean, I realized the importance of integrating learning into daily life.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    April Music Player offers features like LRC syncing, interactive lyrics, note-taking for each lyric, and a personal dictionary for vocabulary collection. Additionally, it includes tools like Zotify, YT-DLP, SpotDL for music downloads, and Syrics, LrcDL for lyrics downloads — all for free!
                </p>
                <p>
                    April Music Player is not just a music player; it’s a companion for both music lovers and language learners. Isn’t it the best way to enjoy music and learn a language at the same time?
