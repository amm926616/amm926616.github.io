        <h3>April Music Player in PyQt6</h3>
        <p>There aren't many music players that support lyric syncing for desktop. I used to rely on OSD Lyrics, but I didn't like how the lyrics weren't interactive. I wished for a feature that would allow me to pause during specific lines and memorize the lyrics. It could be a great study tool, especially when learning a new language.</p>
        <p>A note-taking feature during paused sections will be implemented in the future. For now, Version 1 is being released.</p>

        <h3>No Skip Video Player in PyQt6</h3>
        <p>I hate when I skip through a video and miss important details, but my impatient mind often leads me to do just that. 
            So, I created a video player without media-seeking features. 
            It records the time where you left off when you close the program. 
            The video player also has a timer to stop playback after a set period, allowing you to relax and enjoy a portion of a video during study breaks before returning to your work. 
            It can also be set to always stay on top of other windows.</p>

        <h3>Sqlite Personal Dictionary</h3>
        <p>I believe Korean and Burmese share a key similarity: both languages build words from base syllables, each with its own meaning. My INTP brain finds it challenging to memorize vocabulary without breaking it down into these components, which led me to create this project.</p>
        <p>Initially, I used Obsidian for note-taking, organizing words by headlines and listing similar meanings beneath each one. However, as my file grew, searching became slow and buggy. I explored other options like Stardict and Goldendict, but they lacked the ability to easily update with new vocabulary. Although I was hesitant to develop my own app due to time constraints and uncertainty about the effort required, I realized all I needed was a simple database and a Python interface. With help from ChatGPT, I created exactly what I needed.</p>
        <p>This program functions as a personal dictionary, allowing you to add, search, and delete words. The keyboard shortcuts make it efficientâ€”pressing 'Enter' in the word panel triggers a search, while 'Enter' in the meaning panel adds a new entry. Deleting requires both fields to be filled. I use it to add syllable meanings and guess the meanings of new words based on their components. Thanks to this program, my vocabulary memorization process is now twice as fast.</p>
        <p>I call it a 'personal dictionary' because it works like a traditional dictionary app, but for me, it's primarily a tool for breaking down vocabulary into its essential parts."</p>

        <h3>EasyPaste in python</h3>
        <p>When I used to work on scanlation and translation for manhwa, I found the process of editing images, removing text, and adding my translations to be tedious. To speed up my workflow, I created this Python project. It detects key events and automatically copies the text from a file when you press Ctrl + V, so all you need to do is paste it into the image.</p>

        <h3>A web scrapping tool for kitty-kats.net</h3>
        <p>
            I got frustrated with the download speed limits on Keep2Share when trying to download MetArt albums from the Kitty-Kats website. This Python script scrapes HD images one by one from redirected hosting sites like 'imagetwist.com,' 'imgspice.com,' and 'turbofile.'
