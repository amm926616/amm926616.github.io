            <h2>Work Experience</h2>
            <p>In addition to my technical skills, I have a wide variety of work experience. I have tutored students in English and taught computer basics to children. I also worked as an intern in jewelry smithing, designing and 3D printing jewelry. I have experience working in the credit product management department at KBZ Bank and in customer service at a shipping company.</p>
            <p>üè´ Teaching:
                I tutored English and taught computer basics to children. I favor an approach that emphasizes intellect and creativity, encouraging abstract thinking and the exploration of ideas with or without real-world examples. My teaching style focuses on delivering the underlying concepts first, inspiring kids to develop a deeper interest in math, science, and the beauty of these subjects. Many of the students I tutored became more passionate about these fields. I take pride in being the kind of teacher who instills curiosity and a love for learning. However, my approach requires active engagement‚Äîlazy students who don't want to think won't thrive under my guidance.</p>
